# Time Report

> Write about what you have done and how long you have worked on each part of the project.

For example: 

- 2025-03-26 14:00 Worked for 3 hours.
  - 3 arrays:
    - 1 to store the opening board
    - 1 to store the name of the squares
    - 1 to store the name of the pieces, for future use
  - 2 buttons:
    - 1 to start the next turn
    - 1 to update the board
  - 2 functions
    - 1 that prints the the board
    - 1 that controls the player turns. Including prompts and if-statements.
   
- 2025-03-27 12:40 Worked for 3 hours.
  - Polished the layout of the game board
    - Added monospace style
    - Made the squares with []
  - 2 arrays
    - 1 for unmoved pawns; so I could make them be able to go 2 squares
    - 1 for legal moves; so the program can restrict how the pieces can move
  - 8 new functions 
    - 2 for the different players turns (because I'm using text the program checks for lowercase characters for white and uppercase for black)
    - 6 for the different pieces to control how they can move
  - Movement restrictions in the Pawn function
    - Implemented how they can move forward
  - 1 while-loop
    - Checks if the player wants to make a legal move and implement that to the game board
  - 1 for-loop
    - Changed how the board is being printed, with a for-loop
